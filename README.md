Introduction to Embedded Systems

Labs taken in Winter 2020

Lab01: Convert array of bits to signed and unsigned numbers with two's complement (in C).

Lab02: Return numbers with different functions, such as adding, subtracting, and square root (in ARM Cortex-M4)

Lab03: Copy 512 bits using different LDR functions.

Lab04: Create 4 functions to return Discriminant, roots, and the Quadratic formula.

Lab05: Translate 2 C functions into ARM Cortex-M4 

Lab06: Create 2 functions to store and retrieve individual bits between an array using without bit-banding and with bit-banding

Lab07: Implement multiplication and division functions without using existing instructions

Lab08: Modification of Lab04 using floating-point instructions instead of integer instructions
